Hi. I'm a Salesforce Developer,  I am doing a task in which I need to use Apex and LWC. 
I was given Acceptance criteria: 
 - All custom metadata, including Apex and LWC code is deployed to environment without errors. 
 - The source code should be without commented or unused functions and methods. 
 - Publicly accessible methods must validate input parameters for correctness and follow fail-fast approach. 
Help me complete the tasks, as an experienced Salesforce Developer.

Here is my first assignment:
 - Create new apex AccountOrdersController class as a back-end actions controller with method getOrders(Id accountId) that accepts account id parameter. 
 - Create wrapper (inner) class OrderDTO for Order SObject. 
 - Create OrderSelector class (with factory method) that incapsulates SOQL query. 
 - Controller must use the selector instead of inline query. 
 - Wrap selected records and return to the caller.

---------------------------------------
Sure, let's break down your assignment step by step and provide solutions for each part.

1. AccountOrdersController Class:
This is the main controller class where you will have the getOrders method that accepts an accountId.

2. OrderDTO Class:
This is the wrapper class for the Order SObject.

3. OrderSelector Class:
This class encapsulates the SOQL query. It should have a factory method to retrieve the orders for the given account.

4. No Inline SOQL Query:
In the AccountOrdersController, you'll use the OrderSelector to fetch the orders, rather than using an inline SOQL.

Here's a basic version of how you can structure the classes:
// AccountOrdersController.cls
public class AccountOrdersController {
    
    public List<OrderDTO> getOrders(Id accountId) {
        // Validate the input
        if(accountId == null || String.isBlank(accountId)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException('Invalid Account ID provided.');
        }
        
        List<Order> orders = OrderSelector.getOrdersByAccountId(accountId);
        List<OrderDTO> orderDTOList = new List<OrderDTO>();
        
        for(Order o : orders) {
            orderDTOList.add(new OrderDTO(o));
        }
        
        return orderDTOList;
    }
    
    // OrderDTO inner class
    public class OrderDTO {
        public Id orderId;
        public String orderName;
        // ... any other fields you might want from the Order object
        
        public OrderDTO(Order o) {
            this.orderId = o.Id;
            this.orderName = o.Name;
            // ... populate other fields
        }
    }
}

// OrderSelector.cls
public class OrderSelector {
    
    public static List<Order> getOrdersByAccountId(Id accountId) {
        return [SELECT Id, Name, ... FROM Order WHERE AccountId = :accountId]; // Add all the necessary fields from Order object
    }
}

This is a basic implementation. Depending on your org and the specific requirements of your project, you may need to make some modifications.

Few Points to Remember:

Validation: Always validate your input. Since the acceptance criteria specify a "fail-fast approach," if you find an issue with your inputs (like a null or invalid Account ID), throw an exception immediately.

Unused Code: Make sure you donâ€™t have any commented-out code or unused methods/functions before deploying.

Tests: Always write unit tests for your code to ensure everything works as expected and you meet the required code coverage for deployment.

Hope this helps you with your assignment! If you have further questions or require deeper assistance with any part, let me know.
