What is the sfdx command to authorize a salesforce Dev Hub and make it a default dev hub?
ChatGPT
As of my last update in September 2021, you can authorize a Salesforce Dev Hub using Salesforce CLI's sfdx command line tool with the following command:

bash
Copy code
sfdx auth:web:login -d -a MyDevHub
Here's what the flags mean:

-d or --setdefaultdevhubusername: This flag specifies that the authorized Dev Hub should be set as the default Dev Hub for all scratch org operations.

-a ALIAS or --setalias ALIAS: This flag sets an alias for the Dev Hub. In the example above, MyDevHub is the alias for easy reference in later sfdx commands.

This command will open a new web browser window where you'll be asked to log in to your Salesforce account. After you log in and grant permission, the CLI will store an authentication token, allowing you to execute further commands that interact with this Dev Hub.

Remember that sfdx is often updated, so be sure to check the latest Salesforce DX Developer Guide or use sfdx help for the most current information.

What is the sfdx command to create a scratch org and make it a default scratch org?
ChatGPT
As of my last update in September 2021, you can create a new scratch org and set it as the default using the sfdx command line tool with the following command:

bash
Copy code
sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a MyScratchOrg -s
Here's a breakdown of the flags and arguments:

-f FILE or --definitionfile FILE: Specifies the path to a scratch org definition file. In this example, config/project-scratch-def.json is the path to the scratch org definition file.

-a ALIAS or --setalias ALIAS: Sets an alias for the scratch org to allow for easier reference. In this example, MyScratchOrg is the alias.

-s or --setdefaultusername: Specifies that this scratch org will be set as the default username for all sfdx operations that require a target username.

Once the command is executed and the scratch org is successfully created, the CLI will set the new scratch org as the default for your project, if you've included the -s flag.

The project-scratch-def.json file defines the shape and features of your scratch org. This file should be located in your Salesforce DX project under the config folder. Here is a simple example of a project-scratch-def.json file:

json
Copy code
{
  "orgName": "Company Name",
  "edition": "Developer",
  "features": ["API", "AuthorApex"],
  "settings": {
    "lightningExperienceSettings": {
      "enableS1DesktopEnabled": true
    },
    "apexSettings": {
      "enableCompileOnDeploy": true
    }
  }
}
