Help me create Apex controller class called AccountOrdersController with method getOrders(Id account Id) that accepts account Id as a parameter end returns related Orders


ChatGPT

Certainly! Below is an example of an Apex controller class called AccountOrdersController that has a method getOrders which accepts an AccountId and returns related Orders:

apex

public class AccountOrdersController {

    // Method to get Orders related to an Account
    public static List<Order> getOrders(Id accountId) {
        if(accountId == null) {
            // Throw an exception or return an empty list based on your requirement
            throw new IllegalArgumentException('AccountId cannot be null');
        }

        return [SELECT Id, Name, OrderNumber, Status, TotalAmount
                FROM Order
                WHERE AccountId = :accountId];
    }

}

Notes:

    Before using the above code, make sure you have the Order object enabled and relevant fields (like TotalAmount) present in your org.
    I added basic error handling for a null accountId. You can enhance this as needed for other potential exceptions or conditions.
    Modify the fields in the SOQL query to fit the fields you need from the Order object.
    Always keep in mind SOQL query governor limits while working with Salesforce Apex. If the possibility of retrieving large amounts of data exists, consider using Batch Apex or other mechanisms to handle large data sets.

Lastly, to use this in your application, you would call this method and pass the desired AccountId:

apex

List<Order> ordersForAccount = AccountOrdersController.getOrders(someAccountId);

And then process ordersForAccount as needed in your application.

Please create all neded classes for this task
o	Create new apex AccountOrdersController class as a back-end actions controller with method getOrders(Id accountId) that accepts account id parameter.
o	Create wrapper (inner) class OrderDTO for Order SObject.
o	Create OrderSelector class (with factory method) that incapsulates SOQL query.
o	Controller must use the selector instead of inline query.
o	Wrap selected records and return to the caller.

Certainly! Let's break this down step by step:

    OrderDTO - Wrapper (inner) class for Order SObject:

apex

public class OrderDTO {
    public Id orderId {get; set;}
    public String name {get; set;}
    public String orderNumber {get; set;}
    public String status {get; set;}
    public Decimal totalAmount {get; set;}

    public OrderDTO(Order ord) {
        this.orderId = ord.Id;
        this.name = ord.Name;
        this.orderNumber = ord.OrderNumber;
        this.status = ord.Status;
        this.totalAmount = ord.TotalAmount;
    }
}

    OrderSelector - Selector class that encapsulates the SOQL query:

apex

public class OrderSelector {
    
    public static List<Order> selectOrdersByAccountId(Id accountId) {
        return [SELECT Id, Name, OrderNumber, Status, TotalAmount
                FROM Order
                WHERE AccountId = :accountId];
    }

}

    AccountOrdersController - Back-end actions controller that uses the OrderSelector to get the data and wraps it in the OrderDTO:

apex

public class AccountOrdersController {

    // Method to get Orders related to an Account
    public static List<OrderDTO> getOrders(Id accountId) {
        if(accountId == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException('AccountId cannot be null');
        }
        
        List<Order> orders = OrderSelector.selectOrdersByAccountId(accountId);
        
        List<OrderDTO> orderDTOs = new List<OrderDTO>();
        for(Order ord : orders) {
            orderDTOs.add(new OrderDTO(ord));
        }

        return orderDTOs;
    }

}

In this manner, we're separating the concerns:

    The OrderDTO takes care of wrapping the Order object into a more controlled, customized object.
    The OrderSelector class is responsible for the database queries.
    The AccountOrdersController class takes care of the business logic, fetching the data using the selector and wrapping it in the DTO.

When using, you would call:

apex

List<OrderDTO> ordersForAccount = AccountOrdersController.getOrders(someAccountId);

And then process the ordersForAccount as needed.

Add fail safe solutions, to accountOrdersController , take ino acount that it will be used in LWC


ChatGPT

When designing an Apex controller for Lightning Web Components (LWC), there are some specific considerations to ensure fail-safe solutions:

    AuraEnabled Annotation: Apex methods that are used by LWC must be annotated with @AuraEnabled.
    Return Types: Use standardized return types, like custom response classes, to ensure the LWC can consistently understand the response.
    Exception Handling: Ensure there's proper exception handling to capture errors gracefully.

With those considerations in mind, here's an updated AccountOrdersController with a fail-safe approach:

apex

public with sharing class AccountOrdersController {

    @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
    public static ResponseWrapper getOrders(Id accountId) {
        ResponseWrapper response = new ResponseWrapper();
        try {
            if(accountId == null) {
                throw new CustomException('AccountId cannot be null');
            }

            List<Order> orders = OrderSelector.selectOrdersByAccountId(accountId);

            List<OrderDTO> orderDTOs = new List<OrderDTO>();
            for(Order ord : orders) {
                orderDTOs.add(new OrderDTO(ord));
            }
            
            response.success = true;
            response.data = orderDTOs;
        } catch(Exception e) {
            response.success = false;
            response.errorMessage = e.getMessage();
        }
        return response;
    }

    // Define a custom exception for better error clarity
    public class CustomException extends Exception {}

    // Define a response wrapper class to standardize the response format
    public class ResponseWrapper {
        @AuraEnabled public Boolean success {get; set;}
        @AuraEnabled public List<OrderDTO> data {get; set;}
        @AuraEnabled public String errorMessage {get; set;}

        public ResponseWrapper() {
            this.success = false;
            this.data = new List<OrderDTO>();
            this.errorMessage = '';
        }
    }

}

Benefits:

    The ResponseWrapper class ensures that the front-end always receives a consistent object structure, regardless of whether the operation was successful or an error occurred.
    Proper exception handling ensures that errors are caught and communicated back to the front end.
    The @AuraEnabled annotation (with cacheable=true) is essential for LWC to call this method and cache the results.
    The custom exception CustomException allows you to throw specific errors and helps in distinguishing user-defined exceptions from system exceptions.

When you use this in your LWC, you would check the success attribute of the returned object to determine if the call was successful. If not, you would use the errorMessage attribute to provide feedback to the user. If the call was successful, you'd process the data in the data attribute.
