In salesforce I need to create an Apex controller class named AccountOrdersController with method getOrders(Id accountId) that takes an Account Id as input parameter, inner (wrapper) class OrderDTO for Order SObject. I also need to create an Apex selector class named OrderSelector (with a factory method) that incapsulates SOQL query. My controller class must use selector class instead of an inline query. Selected records must be wrapped and returned to the caller.

Certainly! Below is an example that demonstrates how to create an Apex controller class named AccountOrdersController with a method getOrders(Id accountId). This example also includes an inner (wrapper) class named OrderDTO for the Order SObject, as well as an Apex selector class named OrderSelector that encapsulates the SOQL query.

OrderSelector.cls
First, let's create an Apex class called OrderSelector that will encapsulate the SOQL query logic for Order objects.

apex
Copy code
public class OrderSelector {
    // Factory method to return new instances of this class
    public static OrderSelector newInstance() {
        return new OrderSelector();
    }
    
    // Method to get Orders based on AccountId
    public List<Order> selectOrdersByAccountId(Id accountId) {
        return [
            SELECT Id, Name, Status, AccountId
            FROM Order
            WHERE AccountId = :accountId
        ];
    }
}
AccountOrdersController.cls
Next, create the AccountOrdersController class, which uses the OrderSelector class to get orders and wraps them in the OrderDTO inner class.

apex
Copy code
public class AccountOrdersController {
    // Inner (wrapper) class to represent an Order
    public class OrderDTO {
        public Id Id { get; set; }
        public String Name { get; set; }
        public String Status { get; set; }
        
        public OrderDTO(Order ord) {
            this.Id = ord.Id;
            this.Name = ord.Name;
            this.Status = ord.Status;
        }
    }
    
    // Method to get Orders based on Account Id
    public List<OrderDTO> getOrders(Id accountId) {
        // Initialize OrderSelector
        OrderSelector orderSelector = OrderSelector.newInstance();
        
        // Get Orders from selector
        List<Order> orders = orderSelector.selectOrdersByAccountId(accountId);
        
        // Wrap Orders in DTO
        List<OrderDTO> orderDTOs = new List<OrderDTO>();
        for(Order ord : orders) {
            orderDTOs.add(new OrderDTO(ord));
        }
        
        // Return the wrapped Orders
        return orderDTOs;
    }
}
In this example:

OrderSelector class provides a selectOrdersByAccountId method that encapsulates the SOQL query to get Order records by AccountId.
AccountOrdersController class has an inner OrderDTO class that wraps the Order object.
The getOrders method uses the OrderSelector class to get orders and wraps them in OrderDTO objects.
Now your controller class uses the selector class for fetching data, and the fetched records are wrapped in OrderDTO objects before being returned to the caller.

Why did you declare those classes as without sharing?
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. The sharing declaration was not included in the provided example, which means that the classes would inherit the sharing settings of the calling class by default. It's a good practice to be explicit about the sharing behavior in your Apex classes, especially when dealing with data access and visibility.

Here are some options for sharing settings in Salesforce Apex:

with sharing: Enforces sharing rules and checks that are in place for the current user.
without sharing: Ignores sharing rules, but still respects organization-wide defaults, field-level security, and other basic access level security.
inherited sharing: Applies the sharing rules of the class from which it is called.
Revised Code
Below are the revised classes with sharing declarations.

OrderSelector.cls
apex
Copy code
public with sharing class OrderSelector {
    // Factory method to return new instances of this class
    public static OrderSelector newInstance() {
        return new OrderSelector();
    }
    
    // Method to get Orders based on AccountId
    public List<Order> selectOrdersByAccountId(Id accountId) {
        return [
            SELECT Id, Name, Status, AccountId
            FROM Order
            WHERE AccountId = :accountId
        ];
    }
}
AccountOrdersController.cls
apex
Copy code
public with sharing class AccountOrdersController {
    // Inner (wrapper) class to represent an Order
    public class OrderDTO {
        public Id Id { get; set; }
        public String Name { get; set; }
        public String Status { get; set; }
        
        public OrderDTO(Order ord) {
            this.Id = ord.Id;
            this.Name = ord.Name;
            this.Status = ord.Status;
        }
    }
    
    // Method to get Orders based on Account Id
    public List<OrderDTO> getOrders(Id accountId) {
        // Initialize OrderSelector
        OrderSelector orderSelector = OrderSelector.newInstance();
        
        // Get Orders from selector
        List<Order> orders = orderSelector.selectOrdersByAccountId(accountId);
        
        // Wrap Orders in DTO
        List<OrderDTO> orderDTOs = new List<OrderDTO>();
        for(Order ord : orders) {
            orderDTOs.add(new OrderDTO(ord));
        }
        
        // Return the wrapped Orders
        return orderDTOs;
    }
}
By adding with sharing, both classes now enforce the organization's sharing rules. This is particularly important if you want to ensure that users can only access data that they're allowed to see.
