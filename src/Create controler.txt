Create new apex AccountOrdersController class as a back-end actions controller with method getOrders(Id accountId) that accepts account id parameter. 

ChatGPT
Sure, here's an example of an Apex controller class called AccountOrdersController with a getOrders method that accepts an accountId parameter. This class retrieves orders associated with a specified account:

apex
Copy code
public with sharing class AccountOrdersController {

    // Method to retrieve orders for a specified account
    @AuraEnabled
    public static List<Order> getOrders(Id accountId) {
        List<Order> orders = new List<Order>();
        
        // Query for orders related to the specified account
        orders = [SELECT Id, Name, OrderNumber, Status
                  FROM Order
                  WHERE AccountId = :accountId
                  ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC];

        return orders;
    }
}
In this code:

@AuraEnabled annotation allows this method to be called from Lightning components.
The getOrders method accepts an Id parameter accountId, which is used to filter orders related to the specified account.
We query the Order object to retrieve orders associated with the provided account ID and return them as a list of Order records.
You can then use this Apex controller in your Lightning components or Visualforce pages to retrieve orders for a specific account by passing its ID as a parameter to the getOrders method.

Create wrapper (inner) class OrderDTO for Order SObject. 
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can create an inner class called OrderDTO as a wrapper for the Order SObject like this:

apex
Copy code
public with sharing class AccountOrdersController {
    
    // Inner class for OrderDTO wrapper
    public class OrderDTO {
        @AuraEnabled
        public Id orderId { get; set; }
        @AuraEnabled
        public String orderName { get; set; }
        @AuraEnabled
        public String orderNumber { get; set; }
        @AuraEnabled
        public String orderStatus { get; set; }
        
        public OrderDTO(Id orderId, String orderName, String orderNumber, String orderStatus) {
            this.orderId = orderId;
            this.orderName = orderName;
            this.orderNumber = orderNumber;
            this.orderStatus = orderStatus;
        }
    }
    
    // Method to retrieve orders for a specified account
    @AuraEnabled
    public static List<OrderDTO> getOrders(Id accountId) {
        List<OrderDTO> orderDTOs = new List<OrderDTO>();
        
        // Query for orders related to the specified account
        List<Order> orders = [SELECT Id, Name, OrderNumber, Status
                              FROM Order
                              WHERE AccountId = :accountId
                              ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC];
        
        // Convert Order SObjects to OrderDTO wrappers
        for (Order order : orders) {
            OrderDTO orderWrapper = new OrderDTO(order.Id, order.Name, order.OrderNumber, order.Status);
            orderDTOs.add(orderWrapper);
        }
        
        return orderDTOs;
    }
}
In this code:

We've defined an inner class OrderDTO within the AccountOrdersController class, which acts as a wrapper for the Order SObject.
The OrderDTO class has properties corresponding to the fields you want to expose, and a constructor that allows you to initialize these properties when creating instances of OrderDTO.
Inside the getOrders method, we query the Order SObject as before and then convert each Order record into an OrderDTO object before adding it to the orderDTOs list.
Finally, we return a list of OrderDTO objects, which can be used in Lightning components or Visualforce pages to work with order data in a more structured way.

Create OrderSelector class (with factory method) that incapsulates SOQL query.
ChatGPT
Sure, you can create an OrderSelector class with a factory method to encapsulate the SOQL query for retrieving orders. Here's an example:

apex
Copy code
public with sharing class OrderSelector {

    // Factory method to create an instance of OrderSelector
    public static OrderSelector create() {
        return new OrderSelector();
    }

    // Method to retrieve orders for a specified account
    public List<Order> getOrdersForAccount(Id accountId) {
        return [SELECT Id, Name, OrderNumber, Status
                FROM Order
                WHERE AccountId = :accountId
                ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC];
    }
}
In this code:

We have a create factory method that allows you to create an instance of the OrderSelector class.
The getOrdersForAccount method encapsulates the SOQL query for retrieving orders related to a specified account. It takes an accountId parameter and returns a list of Order records.
You can use this OrderSelector class in your Apex code to retrieve orders without directly embedding the SOQL query. Here's an example of how you might use it:

apex
Copy code
OrderSelector orderSelector = OrderSelector.create();
Id accountId = '001XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'; // Replace with the actual account ID
List<Order> orders = orderSelector.getOrdersForAccount(accountId);
This separation of concerns makes your code more modular and easier to maintain, as you can manage the query logic in one place within the OrderSelector class
