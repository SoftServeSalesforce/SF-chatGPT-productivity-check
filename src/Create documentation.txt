## **Testing & Sample Data Generation**

To facilitate manual testing and provide a comprehensive view of the application's capabilities, we've included an Apex script that generates a rich set of sample data. By running this script, you can populate your Salesforce org with example orders, products, and related records, allowing for a hands-on experience with the LWC component.

To execute the script and generate the testing data, use the following Salesforce CLI command:

```sh
sfdx force:apex:execute -f scripts/apex/generateData.apex

This command creates a structured dataset, ensuring that testers and developers alike can fully engage with and assess the application's features without the need for manual data entry.
