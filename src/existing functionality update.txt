Change description:
    Implemented necessary additions and changes to the code base to avoid
    modifying Case records if current user is not the owner of the record
    and current owner of the record is an active user. 

Pre-deployment steps:
    Said a short prayer.

Metadata changes:
    Created UserSelector class with specific method to query existing deactivated users.
    Updated CasesService method preventStatusChangeByNotAnOwner with additional condition. 
    Updated Constants class with new addition.
    Created test class TestUserSelector.
    Updated test class TestCasesService with two additional test methods.

Post-deployment steps:
    Tested new functionality via UI to ensure metadata changes are successful.
    Ran Apex unit tests to make sure they were successful.
    Filled out necessary documentation.
